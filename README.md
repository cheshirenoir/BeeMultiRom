TESTED OK! If you use it in the IC22 socket of a PC85b, you can use double sized ROMs. If you use single sized ROMs, you can then access the lower ROM with PAK4 and the upper ROM with PAK12
This new version uses turned pins (from turned pin sockets. Just cut them mout with side cutters) and will just fit inside the case of a Microbee.
